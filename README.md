# Book-Search-Engine
## Description
Book-Search-Engine is a full stack web-app that uses Google API's books endpoint to connect users to their favorite books. Users can create an account and save their favorite books or books they are interested in reading.

This was an exercise in converting specific API routes into GraphQL queries and mutations. View /server/schemas/resolvers.js for a comprehensive list of changes.

## Usage
